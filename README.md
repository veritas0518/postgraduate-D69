Why? I'm so tired every day. I'm really speechless. I forgot to bring the charger today. Now the charging speed is very slow. I don't know what I can learn from my internship here, but I'm sure 100% won't practice here in the future. It's really like three years. I won't say more than 10 words a day here. It's really terrible, Not only me, many people don't speak. Is this the Internet company? Therefore, if you want to enter a large factory, you must enter a second-line one anyway, otherwise people can't stand it. I just want to get involved in a project and have more internship experience. Why is it so difficult.
